# Finally, a front end for @trumpsratings!

## Introduction
In November 2017, I created [@TrumpsRatings](https://twitter.com/trumpsratings), a Python based Twitter bot running a PostgreSQL backend. My ultimate goal with TrumpsRatings was to create a full stack experience. After writting a public API for the bot, I decided to host the front end separately to evaluate the API.

## Usage
Clone the repository, issue `cd trumpratings-front`, and then `npm install` to install the dependancies. Once the installs are complete, run `npm start` to have a local copy of the site spun up on your machine.

## Contributing
This is a personal project and is still in development. I am not accepting contributions at this time. Please have a look at the core [TrumpRatings](https://github.com/wgeorgecook/trumpratings) project if you choose to contribute there!
